<p>Consider \(n\) observations are drawn from the Bernoulli distribution,</p>

<p>where \(p\) is a parameters representing the probability of success of the Bernoulli distribution.</p>
<p>We are interested in the sampling properties of the sample average \(\overline{Y}\) given by,</p>          
$$
\begin{align}
\overline{Y} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{n} Y_{i},

<span>By increasing the sample size the sample average concentrate more around the mean, i.e., the probability of success, used to generate the data.<br></span>
<span>This is the result of law of large numbers.</span>
